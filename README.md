### 1. About
This is a study of Operations Research (OR), mainly Management Science (MS), approaches in organization. You will gain an understanding of modeling and rational approaches to decision making and their contribution to organizational effectiveness. Analysis and communication are emphasized by using real world applications and cases. Topics include waiting line models (queueing systems), simulation, project scheduling, decision analysis, and dynamic programming applied to tactical and strategic business decisions in functional areas and interfaces among these areas. Implementation using existing software packages of decision models (i.e. Excel macros or add-ins) to solve various managerial problems is an integrated part of this course.

Operations research (OR) is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. Management science (MS) is the broad interdisciplinary study of problem solving and decision making in human organizations, with strong links to management, economics, business, engineering, management consulting, and other fields.

### 2. Objectives
Upon completing this course, you should be able to;

- Develop analytical skills in structuring and analysis (scientific method) of business decision problems which characterize the field of the Operations Research (OR) or Management Science (MS).
- Develop awareness of the complementary nature of the rational and behavioral approaches to decision making and planning.
- Understand usefulness and limitations of selected OR techniques to find solutions to analytical models.
- Use software to generate computer solutions of the models.
- Learn, through case studies, the applications of OR to find solutions to real life business problems including those in the global environment.
- Demonstrate skills in communicating the analysis and results of business decision problems and to work as a member of a team.
- Use the knowledge gained from this course to continue life-long learning in decision technologies to aid business decision making and planning.

### 5. Grading
Students will get a letter at the end of the semester. This grade will reflect his/her personal academic performance in this semester. Additional works to gain some points may be accepted. Course evaluation is totally and only related to student’s course performance and course-based academic performance.

Some assignments and quizzes may be awarded by the instructor with a couple of extra points. Additional bonus points may be given in midterm and final examinations. Participation is not attendance. Instructors may evaluate your in-class performance and give credits free from your other gained points.

| Item | Weigth (%) | Points |
| :--------- | :-----: | :--: |
| Midterm exam	| 40	| 40 |
| Quizzes, class discussions, and participation | 20 | 20 |
| Final exam	| 40	| 40 |

### Quizzes

The quizzes may cover any material discussed in class or assigned in the text. The regular quizzes will be given at the end of class, online quizzes will be on the same day via electronic tools. There will be no make-up quiz.

### Exams
Your examinations are 1.5-hour duration, closed-book, closed-notes. However, I may add a formulation/help/summary sheet to the examination question paper. Please bring in a scientific calculator when taking your examinations.
The exams are not in any particular format so expect both standard numerical problem solving and conceptual type questions. The exams will test your understanding of the material covered in this course. The main objective is to find out how reflective you are in answering the questions correctly, subject to a limited time constraint.

### Responsibilities and Academic Honesty

You have a responsibility to yourselves, your fellow classmates, and me, as an instructor, to join prepared and to participate in classroom discussions. You are responsible for all material presented in class whether or not they are presented. This material includes the lectures and discussions.

Cheating of any type will not be tolerated. Anyone caught plagiarizing, copying from other students, or allowing others to copy his or her work will receive a grade of 0 (zero) on the relevant assignment, quiz, or exam. In certain cases additional penalties may be applied as provided by university regulations.
